# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions Repository

A carefully crafted collection of **LeetCode problem solutions** with clear explanations, optimized approaches, and precise **Time & Space Complexity** for every problem.

This repository is designed for:
- Coding interview preparation  
- Practicing algorithmic thinking  
- Building a strong problem-solving portfolio  
- Reviewing patterns commonly asked in FAANG-level interviews

## 📌 About This Repository

Every solution in this repository is written with clarity and optimization in mind.  
Each problem includes:

- 🧠 **Explanation of the approach**  
- ⏱ **Time Complexity analysis**  
- 💾 **Space Complexity analysis**  
- 🧪 **Clean and readable code structure**  
- 🔁 **Multiple approaches when helpful**  

The goal is to help you understand *why* a solution works, not just memorize it.

## 🧩 Standard Problem Format

All LeetCode problems in this repository follow this structured documentation template:


This standard keeps all solutions **consistent, professional, and easy to revise**.

- Hash Maps / Sets  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Binary Trees  
- Binary Search Trees (BST)  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path)  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, Kadane, LIS, Knapsack…)  
- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search (on arrays, answers, boundaries)

## 🔥 Why This Repository Stands Out

- Consistent problem documentation format  
- Optimized, interview-ready solutions  
- Clear complexity analysis for every problem  
- Covers major LeetCode patterns and problem types  
- Easy to navigate for revision or interview prep  
- Beginner-friendly yet strong enough for advanced prep  

Whether you're preparing for FAANG interviews or strengthening fundamentals, this repo supports you.

## ✨ How to Use This Repository

1. Pick a LeetCode problem you want to study.  
2. Read the explanation and understand the approach.  
3. Review the time and space complexity.  
4. Practice writing the code yourself.  
5. Compare with alternative approaches (if available).  

This process ensures mastery of patterns—not memorization.

# DSA-LeetCode
# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions Repository

A curated and well-structured collection of **LeetCode problem solutions** with clear explanations, optimized approaches, and detailed **Time & Space Complexity** for every problem.

This repository is focused entirely on **LeetCode + DSA practice** and is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews, strengthen problem-solving skills, and build a strong portfolio.

## 📌 About This Repository

Each solution in this repository includes:

- 🧠 **Approach Explanation**  
- ⏱ **Time Complexity**  
- 💾 **Space Complexity**  
- 🧪 **Clean, interview-friendly code**  
- 🔁 **Multiple approaches (when useful)**  

The purpose is not just solving problems — it's understanding patterns used in real interviews.
